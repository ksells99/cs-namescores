C# console application that sorts a list of comma-separated names from a text file and calculates a 'name score' by multiplying the total alphabetical value of each name by its position in the sorted list. It then logs the total for every name score combined to the console.

The filepath is dynamic and can be entered as an argument when running the app:

`dotnet run filename.txt`
